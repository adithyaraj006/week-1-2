# Smart Waste Classification System using CNN
## WEEK 1
## Problem Statement
Improper waste segregation causes difficulties in recycling and leads to environmental pollution. Manual waste sorting is inefficient and unhygienic. Therefore, there is a need for an automated system that can classify waste accurately.

## Proposed Solution
This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification model that can automatically categorize waste into different types such as plastic, paper, metal, glass, cardboard, and trash.  
By automating waste classification, the project promotes sustainable waste management and supports Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12).

## Dataset (Planned for Week 2)
The dataset selected for this project is **TrashNet**, available on **Kaggle**.  
It contains images of waste items categorized into six classes:
- Cardboard  
- Glass  
- Metal  
- Paper  
- Plastic  
- Trash  

This dataset will be used in the next phase of the project for training and testing the CNN model.

## WEEK 2
Week 2 Focus — Dataset Preparation & Preprocessing
🗃 Dataset Used
Name: TrashNet Dataset
Source: Kaggle – TrashNet Dataset
Description:
The dataset contains labeled images of waste items in six categories:
Cardboard
Glass
Metal
Paper
Plastic
Trash
🔍 Tasks Completed in Week 2
During Week 2, the TrashNet dataset was successfully downloaded and explored to understand its structure and class distribution. The dataset was organized into six categories — cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. A few sample images from each class were visualized to verify data quality. Basic preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, and validation splitting were performed using the ImageDataGenerator class. Additionally, the initial architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed, which will be used for model training in the upcoming week.
